    "\n",
    "Making maps is a fundamental part of geoscience research.\n",
    "Maps differ from regular figures in the following principle ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maps require a *projection* of geographic coordinates on the 3D Earth to the 2D space of your figure.\n",
    "- Maps often include extra decorations besides just our data (e.g. continents, country borders, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mapping is a notoriously hard and complicated problem, mostly due to the complexities of projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will learn about [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/), one of the most common packages for making maps within python. Another popular and powerful library is [Basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/); however, Basemap is [going away](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/intro.html#cartopy-new-management-and-eol-announcement) and being replaced with Cartopy in the near future. For this reason, new python learners are recommended to learn Cartopy.\n",
