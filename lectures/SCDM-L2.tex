\section{Introduction to programming languages}
\begin{frame}{Programming languages}

\begin{itemize}
\item A programming language is a set of structured instructions that tell
the computer what to do. There have been many programming languages
in the history of computer science. Some of them survived from the
early 60's (FORTRAN) or evolved (ANSI C into C++ and C\#) but only
a few are very much used today in general applications: Python, C++,
PHP, and Java.
\item Why so many languages? (\href{http://www.levenez.com/lang/}{http://www.levenez.com/lang/})
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{High-level and low level languages}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\small{}FORTRAN, Python, C++, PHP, C\#, Java, etc }\textbf{\small{}are
high-level languages}{\small\par}
\item {\small{}There are also low-level languages, sometimes referred to
as machine languages or assembly languages. Loosely speaking, computers
can only execute programs written in low-level languages. Thus, programs
written in a high-level language have to be translated into something
more suitable before they can run. (Useful resource: http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html)}{\small\par}
\item {\small{}Almost all programs are written in high-level languages because
of their advantages. It is much easier to program in a high-level
language so programs take less time to write, they are shorter and
easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. Secondly,
high-level languages are portable, meaning that they can run on different
kinds of computers with few or no modifications}{\small\par}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The winning trend in computer programming}

\begin{itemize}
\item To create and work with objects:

\begin{itemize}
\item Reusable software components that model items in the real world
\item Meaningful software units: Date objects, time objects, invoice objects,
audio objects, video objects, file objects, record objects, model
grid objects, etc. These classes allow to define the rules controlling
the ``life'' of these objects in the code
\item Any noun can be represented as an object
\end{itemize}
\item Very reusable
\item More understandable, better organized, and easier to maintain than
procedural programming
\item Favour modularity
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Interpreters and compilers (I)}

\begin{itemize}
\item The instructions for the computer need to be fed to the CPU. How does
it happen? Through \textbf{interpreters} and/or \textbf{compilers}.\footnote{https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en\_US.ISO8859-1/books/developers-handbook/tools-programming.html}
\item With an \textbf{interpreter}, the language comes as an environment,
where you type in commands at a prompt and the environment executes
them for you. For more complicated programs, you can type the commands
into a file and get the interpreter to load the file and execute the
commands in it. If anything goes wrong, many interpreters will drop
you into a debugger to help you track down the problem.
\item The advantage of this is that you can see the results of your commands
immediately, and mistakes can be corrected readily.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Interpreters and compilers (II)}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Compilers} are rather different. You write your code in a
file (or files) using an \textbf{editor} (that interpret ASCII characters,
like textedit in windows). You then run the compiler and see if it
accepts your program. If it did not compile, \emph{grit your teeth}
and go back to the editor; if it did compile and gave you an \textbf{executable
program} (an \emph{app}), you can run it either at a shell command
prompt or in a debugger to see if it works properly. 
\item Not quite as direct as using an interpreter. However it allows you
to do things that are very difficult or even impossible with an interpreter:
writing code which interacts closely with the operating system; write
very efficient code, as the compiler can optimize the code, which
would not be acceptable in an interpreter. Finally, this is the way
people create \emph{apps} for various operating systems!
\item As the edit-compile-run-debug cycle is rather tedious when using separate
programs, many commercial compiler makers have produced \textbf{Integrated
Development Environments} (IDEs for short). 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The UNIX shell and the home directory}

The language used in the terminal shell is an interpreted language.It
allows you to interact with the file system and your data files. When
the terminal is launched, it usually goes to your personal directory
(the unix name for a folder), which is called your \emph{home} (note
that in WSL this is your windows home)
\begin{itemize}
\item All the users' directories are in /home
\end{itemize}
\begin{lyxcode}
/home/marcello

/home/student
\end{lyxcode}
\begin{itemize}
\item It is the location where all your files go (organised into subdirectories).
Location of many startup and customization files.
\item It can be local (as in your case) or \emph{mounted} from an external
file server
\item Run the command \texttt{cd} (change directory, by itself) to take
you home from wherever you are
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The UNIX filesystem}
\centering \includegraphics[width=5cm]{figures/unix_filesystem.png}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\footnotesize{}Every file has a name and }\textbf{\footnotesize{}file
names}{\footnotesize{} are case-sensitive! Unix file names can contain
any characters (although some make it difficult to access the file)
except the null character and the slash (/). }{\footnotesize\par}
\item {\footnotesize{}A }\textbf{\footnotesize{}directory}{\footnotesize{}
is a special kind of file - Unix uses a directory to hold information
about other files}{\footnotesize\par}
\item {\footnotesize{}Each file in the same directory must have a unique
name. Files that are in different directories can have the same name.
Files that start with a '.' are by default hidden}{\footnotesize\par}
\item {\footnotesize{}The }\textbf{\footnotesize{}filesystem}{\footnotesize{}
is a hierarchical system of organizing files and directories. The
top level in the hierarchy is called the \textquotedbl root\textquotedbl{}
and holds all files and directories. The name of the root directory
is / }{\footnotesize\par}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{The UNIX pathname}
\begin{columns}[t]


\column{7cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\footnotesize{}The }\textbf{\footnotesize{}pathname}{\footnotesize{}

of the directory that holds the file, AND the name of the directory
that holds the directory that holds the file, AND the name of the
\dots{} and so on up to the root }{\footnotesize\par}
\item {\footnotesize{}These pathnames are called }\textbf{\footnotesize{}absolute
pathnames}{\footnotesize\par}
\item {\footnotesize{}The pathname of every file in a given filesystem is
unique}{\footnotesize\par}
\item {\footnotesize{}You can use }\textbf{\footnotesize{}relative pathnames}{\footnotesize{},
that depend on the current working directory}{\footnotesize\par}

\begin{frame}{Practicing is the only way forward}

The UNIX commands are mnemonic, hence the only way to learn them is
through practicing a few examples
\begin{itemize}
\item Read the quick introduction found here \href{https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/lectures/environment/intro_to_unix.html}{https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/lectures/environment/intro\_to\_unix.html}
\item Practice the tutorial on VULA (from \href{http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/}{Software Carpentry})
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Example: a batch script to retrieve multiple files}
\begin{itemize}
\item The example below is a program (\emph{script}) written in \emph{bash}
(Bourn Again SHell, the default shell in linux) that uses the unix
commands \texttt{seq} and \texttt{wget} to download monthly ocean
colour data files from the ESA OC-CCI website for the years 2010-2015.
This script is stored in an ASCII file that has been created with
a text editor and named \texttt{multiple\_oc-cci.sh}. Check the most recent version of the occci dataset.

\section{Algorithms, syntax and code structures}
\begin{frame}{Matrix approach to scientific computing}

\begin{itemize}
\item The previous script is a basic example of the \emph{loop construct},
which is a sequential iterative operation on a given data type
\item Matlab was one of the first languages to introduce complex data structures
(such as vectors and matrices) as \emph{atomic} data types in an interpreted
language
\item This allowed the user to work with them as if they were scalar variables
and without the need for explicit looping (\emph{a lot} more efficient)
\item To appreciate the importance of this in the era of drag'n drop, graphical
user interfaces and object-oriented programming, check out how low-level
programming languages used to do the addition of a constant to a list
of numbers (a vector)

An algorithm is a specific set of instructions for carrying out a

al-Khw\={a}rizm\={\i}, a Persian mathematician who wrote an influential
treatise about algebraic methods

is called a computation
\item Algorithms are presented as flow charts and usually expressed in meta-language
terms
