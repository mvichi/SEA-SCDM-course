## 📌 Instructions

One major barrier to learning new tools is the lack of familiarity with technical terms (**jargon**). These terms are often taken for granted in computer science and rarely explained.

For example, in DataCamp tutorials, you may encounter concepts like `"strings"` or `"arrays"` that might not be immediately clear.

### ✅ Your Task

- Submit a **PDF document** containing:
  - A list of **at least 10 technical terms** (names, concepts, phrases, etc.) that:
    - You don’t understand, **or**
    - You couldn’t find a satisfactory explanation for online.
  - Your **own understanding** of each term.
  - **Links** to the resources you consulted and how AI was used.

- To **maximize your mark**, also include:
  - Your **personal explanation** of terms that initially confused you but now make sense.
  - ⚠️ **Note:** Obvious terms will **not** be counted!
