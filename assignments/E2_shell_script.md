# E2 Shell Script Example

Use the terminal and the shell software that you have learnt in the tutorial to run the example script from lecture **L2**.
Test the download of the ocean colour data for the years **2014** and **2015**.

## Creating the Script

To create the script, you will need to use a text editor (like `nano`).
Because of the first line in the script, the file will become a new command executed by the shell, that can be executed from the command line.

To make the file executable, run:

```bash
chmod +x FILENAME
```

## Submission Instructions

Submit a **PDF** with the following content:

1. The **listing of the script** (use a computer code fixed font like Courier).
2. A **portion of the output** produced by the script while it is running.

   > Not the whole output, only a fragment!
   > You do not need to download all the files since each one is 292 MB.

You can interrupt the execution of the script with `CTRL-C`.

## Notes

* The script will generate the same directory structure that is found on the remote server.
* Use the command `tree` to show the content of the generated folders.
* This command is not installed in your system and can be installed using **apt** or **brew**.
